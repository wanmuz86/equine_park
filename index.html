<p>Equine Park is the first development of <em>Equine Capital Berhad (ECB)</em> among its 4 projects in the area of <strong>Seri Kembangan</strong>. It is a housing estate that is fully developed on a 450-acre of leasehold land, with the exception of some bungalows and semi-detached homes at one end. Equine Park is an exclusive enclave that is surrounded by lush greenery and beautiful landscape. Hence, it brings you a fresh, quiet and comfortable living environment as well as peace of mind by the 24-hour security system. </p>
<p> Equine Park is situated at a great location as amenities can be accessible easily. Just within a short distance, there are police station, 24-hour clinic, General Serdang Hospital, bank, post office, kindergarten, petrol station, super market (Pasar Borong Selangor), Alice Smith International School, University of Putra Malaysia (UPM), and Equine Jusco. Besides, it is neighboring with other residential developments such as Serdang Heights, Bukit Ikhlas, Alam Sanctuary and D'Alpina. Apart from that, Equine Park can be accessible conveniently through major highways and roads, namely Lebuhraya Damansara-Puchong (LDP), Maju Expressway, the North-South Expressway, ELITE Highway, Silk Highway, and KL-Putrajaya Highway. With these well-linked highways, Equine Park is proximity closed to other vibrant townships, namely <strong>Puchong</strong>, <strong>Bukit Jalil</strong>, <strong>Putrajaya</strong>, <strong>Cyberjaya</strong>, and <strong>Shah Alam</strong>. Other than that, there is a KTM station (Station Serdang) and bus stations just 5 minutes away from Equine Park for the convenience of students living there.</p>
